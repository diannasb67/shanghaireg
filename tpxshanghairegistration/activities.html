                    artist Xue Song who initially was attracted to the extremely low rent for unused industrial space.
                    About 25 percent today of the former factories have now been converted into fabulous art galleries,
                    design center and studios. Walk thru and marvel at the odd little Propaganda Poster Art Museum which

                    eyes behold the beauty of and variety of the Cherry Blossoms which cover and area of 4.3 million sq
